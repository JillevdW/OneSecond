# OneSecond
I often think of something while I'm in the middle of something else. Actually, that's how this idea came to me. But I can't just write it down when I'm currently taking a call from a client, or when I'm trying to focus on something else. So that's why I made `OneSecond`: I needed a way to quickly jot down something, only to get a reminder a few minutes later.

### Let's talk features
Almost none! Which is exactly the point; to provide a way to jot down a thought without too much distraction:

##### Add a reminder
Press `command + shift + L` to open up the textarea to schedule a task. Press `enter` to add a reminder for it.

##### Check/remove scheduled reminders
Click the OneSecond icon in the menubar of your Mac to show your first three notifications. Press the black button next to a reminder to remove it. The red button in the top left can be used the close the application, and the yellow button will close the popup.
